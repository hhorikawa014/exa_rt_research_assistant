This model is defined as a classifier to classify as "normal" if the region of interest is within the predicted regions and "malignancy" if the genomic regions are not within the predicted regions.

This model was constructed using the class :class:`~gcn.contrib.support_vector_classifier.SV_Classifier` class.
